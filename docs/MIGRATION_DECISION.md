# Migration Decision: Should We Keep Both MongoDB and Prisma?

## TL;DR: NO - Use Prisma Only

**Decision**: Use **Prisma + SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (production)** ONLY in the new repo. Do NOT keep MongoDB or Mongoose.

## Your Question

> "shall i migrate to prisma completely? if yes why or we keep mongoose as well and slowly route by route migrate to prisma if prisma is better or drizzle or whatever is better same for postgres as well we will keep mongodb for now but after few weeks we might migrate to prostgres"

## My Answer: Complete Migration to Prisma

### Why NOT to keep both databases?

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Data Consistency** | Which database is the source of truth? How do you keep them in sync? |
| **Double Complexity** | Two connection pools, two query syntaxes, two migration systems |
| **Developer Confusion** | "Do I query MongoDB or PostgreSQL for this?" |
| **Double Testing** | Test against both databases, seed both databases |
| **Defeats Purpose** | You created this new repo to **escape complexity** - don't bring it back! |
| **Deployment Complexity** | Need to deploy and maintain both database servers |
| **Cost** | Pay for two database hosting services |

### Why Prisma over Mongoose?

| Feature | Mongoose (MongoDB) | Prisma (SQL) |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Type Safety** | Manual type definitions, runtime errors | Auto-generated types, compile-time safety |
| **Migrations** | Manual or mongoose-migrate | Built-in `prisma migrate` |
| **Database Support** | MongoDB only | SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server |
| **Query Syntax** | String-based, error-prone | Type-safe, autocomplete |
| **Developer Tools** | MongoDB Compass | Prisma Studio (built-in) |
| **Learning Curve** | Need to know MongoDB-specific concepts | SQL-like, universally understood |
| **TypeScript Integration** | Good | Excellent |
| **Production Ready** | Yes | Yes |

### What We've Built

**Completed**: ✅ Complete Prisma schema with all 7 database models

```prisma
✅ Funnel          - Main funnel configuration (80% of queries)
✅ GlobalAppConfig - Shop settings and sync tracking
✅ OfferCustomization - Widget styling
✅ DefaultOfferStyle - Default style templates
✅ OrderHistory - Orders for analytics
✅ FreeGiftTracking - Gift tracking
✅ Session - Shopify OAuth (already existed)
```

**Schema Features**:
- JSON fields for complex nested data (preserves old structure)
- Proper indexes for performance
- Soft deletes (deletedAt field)
- A/B testing support (rollout fields)
- Works with SQLite (dev) AND PostgreSQL (prod) - same code!

## Recommended Migration Strategy

### Approach: Parallel Apps

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        OLD APP (Keep Running)                   │
│  • MongoDB + Mongoose                           │
│  • Production traffic                           │
│  • /Users/adi/magic/upsell-app-dev/            │
│  • DON'T TOUCH - keeps serving users           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      │
                      │ Keep separate
                      │
                      ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        NEW APP (Build Fresh)                    │
│  • Prisma + PostgreSQL                          │
│  • Development & Staging ONLY (for now)        │
│  • /Users/adi/magic/upsell-cross-sell-...      │
│  • Build features end-to-end                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Migration Phases

#### Phase 1: Build New App ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Created complete Prisma schema
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Multi-environment configuration (staging/production)

#### Phase 2: Copy Code & Adapt (CURRENT)
- [ ] Copy services from old app
- [ ] Rewrite MongoDB queries → Prisma queries
- [ ] Copy API routes, update database calls
- [ ] Build admin UI
- [ ] Copy frontend embeds
- [ ] Deploy Shopify Functions

#### Phase 3: Test Thoroughly
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Ensure all features work
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing

#### Phase 4: Data Migration (One-Time)
When ready to switch production:
```typescript
// scripts/migrate-data-from-mongo.ts
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';
import { prisma } from './db.server';

async function migrate() {
  // Connect to OLD MongoDB
  const mongo = new MongoClient(OLD_MONGO_URL);

  // Copy all funnels
  const oldFunnels = await mongo.db().collection('funnels').find().toArray();
  for (const old of oldFunnels) {
    await prisma.funnel.create({
      data: {
        id: old._id.toString(),
        shop: old.shop,
        name: old.name,
        // ... map all fields
      }
    });
  }

  // Copy all other collections
  // ...
}
```

#### Phase 5: Switch Production
1. Schedule downtime window (2-4 hours)
2. Run data migration script
3. Switch DNS/traffic to new app
4. Monitor closely
5. Keep old app running for 1 week as backup
6. Decommission old app

## Current Database Structure

### Development (RIGHT NOW)
```
New App: SQLite (file:dev.sqlite)
- No setup required
- Perfect for local development
- Same Prisma queries as production
```

### Production (WHEN READY)
```
New App: PostgreSQL
- Update .env.production: DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
- Same Prisma queries as development
- Update datasource in schema.prisma to "postgresql"
```

## What About Drizzle ORM?

**Drizzle** is also excellent (lighter than Prisma), but:
- Smaller ecosystem
- Fewer tutorials and examples
- Newer (less battle-tested)
- Smaller community

**My take**: **Stick with Prisma**. It's mature, well-documented, and widely adopted.

## Code Comparison

### OLD (Mongoose + MongoDB)
```typescript
// Find active funnels
const funnels = await Funnel.find({
  shop,
  status: 'active'
});

// No type safety
// Runtime errors only
// Manual type definitions
```

### NEW (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
```typescript
import { prisma } from "~/db.server";

// Find active funnels
const funnels = await prisma.funnel.findMany({
  where: {
    shop,
    active: true
  }
});

// Full type safety ✅
// Autocomplete works ✅
// Compile-time errors ✅
// Auto-generated types ✅
```

## Migration Complexity

### Your Old App Stats (from docs)
- **8 MongoDB collections**
- **173+ database queries** across 36+ files
- **2 repository classes** with complex priority logic
- **Complex nested schemas** (GroupSchema, RuleSchema, MilestoneSchema, etc.)

### Handling Complexity
**We're using JSON fields in Prisma** to preserve nested structures:
```prisma
model Funnel {
  // Simple fields as columns
  shop      String
  name      String
  type      String

  // Complex nested data as JSON
  groups     Json?  // Array of {rules: [{...}]}
  milestones Json?  // Array of milestone objects
  // etc...
}
```

**Why this works**:
- Preserves your existing data structure
- Easy migration from MongoDB
- Can query JSON fields in PostgreSQL
- Type-safe at the top level

## Next Steps

### What You Should Do Now

1. **Don't modify old app** - Leave it running in production

2. **Start migrating one feature** - I recommend Cart Progress Bar:
   - Copy FunnelRepository logic
   - Rewrite queries from Mongoose to Prisma
   - Copy API routes
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Build incrementally**:
   - One feature at a time
   - Test each feature
   - Commit frequently

4. **Test in staging** with real Shopify store

5. **When confident**, run data migration and switch production

### Can I Help You Start?

I can help you migrate your first feature. The best candidates are:

**Option 1: Cart Progress Bar** ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Complete feature end-to-end
- Tests your entire stack (DB → API → UI → Function)
- Not too complex

**Option 2: Simple API endpoint**
- Start with `/api/health` or `/api/customization`
- Build confidence with simple queries

**Which feature would you like to start with?**

## Summary

### ✅ DO
- Use Prisma + SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) in new repo
- Keep old app running separately
- Build new app completely before switching
- One-time data migration when ready
- Test thoroughly in staging

### ❌ DON'T
- Keep both MongoDB and PostgreSQL in new repo
- Try to maintain two databases in sync
- Migrate incrementally with both databases
- Bring complexity into clean new repo

### 🎯 Goal
**Clean break. Clean start. Migrate once when ready.**
